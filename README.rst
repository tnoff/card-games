Card games in java, to practice java.


==============
General Design
==============

- There should be classes for playing cards/decks.
    - There should be classes for card hands.
    - Having a hand class should help with abstraction of different games.
      For example, have blackjack hands vs poker hands, but use same
      card classes.

- There should be classes for people/players.
